## Recommendation Scoring — Vector Design

Estates are ranked using **weighted cosine similarity** between a buyer-preference vector and a flat vector. Each vector has **7 dimensions**:

| Dim | Feature | Encoding | Why a vector dimension |
|-----|---------|----------|----------------------|
| 0 | Floor preference | High → 1.0, Mid → 0.66, Low → 0.33, "Any" → 0.5 | Genuinely bidirectional — "mid" means not too high and not too low; a one-sided constraint (e.g. min floor) would use a pre-filter instead |
| 1 | MRT proximity | count within 1.0 km / cap 3, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Preference with diminishing returns — more MRT stations nearby is always better; cosine rewards alignment between buyer desire and estate supply |
| 2 | Hawker centre | count within 1.0 km / cap 5, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Same rationale as MRT — amenity density is a genuine preference, not a hard constraint |
| 3 | Shopping mall | count within 1.5 km / cap 3, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Same rationale; wider threshold (1.5 km) reflects typical acceptable walking distance to a mall |
| 4 | Park | count within 1.0 km / cap 4, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Same rationale as MRT |
| 5 | School | count within 1.0 km / cap 4, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Same rationale as MRT |
| 6 | Hospital | count within 3.0 km / cap 2, clamped [0,1]; buyer: 1.0 if must-have, else 0.5 | Same rationale; wider threshold (3.0 km) reflects that hospitals are sparse and typically reached by transport |

### Why budget, remaining lease, flat type, and region are NOT vector dimensions

Cosine similarity measures the *angle* between two vectors — it rewards alignment and penalises deviation in **both** directions. This is correct for genuine preferences (e.g., floor level, amenity proximity) but wrong for **one-sided constraints** and **hard-filtered features**:

- **Budget** is an **upper-bound constraint**: an estate that costs *less* than the buyer's budget is always acceptable — it should never be penalised. Making budget a vector dimension would penalise affordable estates for being "too cheap."
- **Remaining lease** is a **lower-bound constraint**: an estate with *more* remaining lease than the buyer requires is always acceptable. Making lease a vector dimension would penalise estates for having *too much* lease — the opposite of what the buyer wants.
- **Flat type** is a **hard pre-filter**: `analyse_town_prices(town, ftype)` queries only transactions matching the buyer's exact flat type. Every candidate already has the same flat type, so a vector dimension would be identical for all candidates and add zero discrimination.
- **Region** is a **hard pre-filter**: step 3 of the recommender restricts candidates to towns in the buyer's selected regions. Every candidate's region already matches, so a vector dimension would always score the same.

All four are handled as **pre-filters** that eliminate estates before cosine scoring:
- Budget: estate's 25th-percentile price must be ≤ buyer's effective budget × 1.05
- Lease: estate's average remaining lease must be ≥ buyer's minimum lease requirement
- Flat type: DB query selects only matching flat type
- Region: candidate town list restricted to selected regions

### How cosine similarity scoring works

The score is the weighted cosine between the buyer vector and the flat vector:

$$\text{score} = \cos(W \odot \vec{b},\; W \odot \vec{f})$$

where $W[i] = 1.0$ if the criterion for dimension $i$ is **active** (buyer made a meaningful choice), or $0.25$ if **inactive** (left at default).

**Active criteria detection:**

| Criterion | Active when | Vector dims |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `budget` | effective\_budget > 0 | none (pre-filter only) |
| `flat` | ftype ≠ "any" | 0 |
| `region` | regions list non-empty | none (pre-filter only) |
| `amenity` | must\_have list non-empty | 1–6 |

If even one must-have amenity is selected, **all 6 amenity dims** (1–6) get W = 1.0.

### Amenity count scoring

Amenity dims 1–6 use count-within-threshold / cap, clamped to [0, 1]:

$$\text{amenity\_score} = \min\left(\frac{\text{count\_within}}{\text{cap}}, 1.0\right)$$

| Amenity | Threshold | Cap |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| MRT station | 1.0 km | 3 |
| Hawker centre | 1.0 km | 5 |
| Shopping mall | 1.5 km | 3 |
| Park | 1.0 km | 4 |
| Primary school | 1.0 km | 4 |
| Hospital | 3.0 km | 2 |

This rewards **amenity density**: an estate with 2 MRT stations within 1.0 km scores higher than one with 1, reflecting genuine liveability.

### Worked examples

#### Scenario 1 — Strong match (score ≈ 0.98)

**Inputs:** `ftype="4 ROOM"`, `regions=["central"]`, `floor="high"`, `must_have=["mrt","hawker","park"]`, `budget=$500k`  
**Flat:** TOA PAYOH (central), `storey_range="37 TO 42"`, amenities: mrt×2, hawker×4, mall×1, park×3, school×3, hospital×1  
*(Pre-filters already applied: ftype selects DB query, region restricts town list, budget/lease filter candidates)*

**Active criteria:** `budget>0` ✓ | `ftype≠"any"` ✓ | `regions≠[]` ✓ | `must_have≠[]` ✓  
→ active = [budget, flat, region, amenity]  
→ W = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

**Buyer vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `FLOOR_PREF_ORD["high"]` | 1.0000 |
| 1 | `"mrt" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 2 | `"hawker" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 3 | `"mall" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 4 | `"park" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 5 | `"school" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 6 | `"hospital" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |

**Flat vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `storey_midpoint("37 TO 42") = 39.5 / 50` | 0.7900 |
| 1 | `count_within=2 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mrt"]=3` | 0.6667 |
| 2 | `count_within=4 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hawker"]=5` | 0.8000 |
| 3 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mall"]=3` | 0.3333 |
| 4 | `count_within=3 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["park"]=4` | 0.7500 |
| 5 | `count_within=3 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["school"]=4` | 0.7500 |
| 6 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hospital"]=2` | 0.5000 |

**Why ≈0.98:** Floor close (buyer=1.0 vs flat=0.79). Active amenity dims (mrt, hawker, park) have buyer=1.0 vs flat 0.67–0.80 — close to parallel. Non-preferred amenities (mall buyer=0.5, flat=0.33) contribute at full W=1.0 but the small values don't drag much.

---

#### Scenario 2 — Moderate match (score ≈ 0.78)

**Inputs:** `ftype="4 ROOM"`, `regions=["east"]`, `floor="any"`, `must_have=["mrt"]`, `budget=$400k`  
**Flat:** JURONG WEST (east region pre-filter passed this town via fallback top-up), `storey_range="01 TO 03"`, amenities: mrt×3, hawker×2, mall×1, park×1, school×2, hospital×0  
*(Pre-filters already applied: ftype selects DB query, budget/lease filter candidates)*

**Active criteria:** `budget>0` ✓ | `ftype≠"any"` ✓ | `regions≠[]` ✓ | `must_have≠[]` ✓  
→ active = [budget, flat, region, amenity]  
→ W = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

**Buyer vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `FLOOR_PREF_ORD["any"]` | 0.5000 |
| 1 | `"mrt" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 2 | `"hawker" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 3 | `"mall" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 4 | `"park" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 5 | `"school" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 6 | `"hospital" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |

**Flat vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `storey_midpoint("01 TO 03") = 2 / 50` | 0.0400 |
| 1 | `count_within=3 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mrt"]=3` | 1.0000 |
| 2 | `count_within=2 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hawker"]=5` | 0.4000 |
| 3 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mall"]=3` | 0.3333 |
| 4 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["park"]=4` | 0.2500 |
| 5 | `count_within=2 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["school"]=4` | 0.5000 |
| 6 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hospital"]=2` | 0.0000 |

**Why ≈0.78:** MRT matches perfectly (1.0 vs 1.0). Floor hurts (buyer=0.5 "any" vs flat=0.04 ground floor). Hospital dim drags (buyer=0.5 neutral vs flat=0.0). Region mismatch is handled by the pre-filter (this estate appeared via fallback top-up when <10 results passed region filter).

---

#### Scenario 3 — Poor match (score ≈ 0.55)

**Inputs:** `ftype="5 ROOM"`, `regions=["central"]`, `floor="high"`, `must_have=["mrt","hawker","park","school"]`, `budget=$600k`  
**Flat:** JURONG WEST (central region pre-filter passed via fallback top-up), `storey_range="01 TO 03"`, amenities: mrt×0, hawker×1, mall×0, park×0, school×0, hospital×0  
*(Pre-filters already applied: ftype selects DB query, budget/lease filter candidates)*

**Active criteria:** `budget>0` ✓ | `ftype≠"any"` ✓ | `regions≠[]` ✓ | `must_have≠[]` ✓  
→ active = [budget, flat, region, amenity]  
→ W = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

**Buyer vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `FLOOR_PREF_ORD["high"]` | 1.0000 |
| 1 | `"mrt" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 2 | `"hawker" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 3 | `"mall" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 4 | `"park" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 5 | `"school" in must_have → 1.0` | 1.0000 |
| 6 | `"hospital" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |

**Flat vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `storey_midpoint("01 TO 03") = 2 / 50` | 0.0400 |
| 1 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mrt"]=3` | 0.0000 |
| 2 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hawker"]=5` | 0.2000 |
| 3 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mall"]=3` | 0.0000 |
| 4 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["park"]=4` | 0.0000 |
| 5 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["school"]=4` | 0.0000 |
| 6 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hospital"]=2` | 0.0000 |

**Why ≈0.55:** Nearly every active dim is mismatched — floor (1.0 vs 0.04), mrt (1.0 vs 0.0), park (1.0 vs 0.0), school (1.0 vs 0.0). Even hawker only partially matches (1.0 vs 0.2). Vectors point in very different directions.

---

#### Scenario 4 — No amenity preference (score ≈ 0.96)

**Inputs:** `ftype="3 ROOM"`, `regions=["north"]`, `floor="mid"`, `must_have=[]`, `budget=$300k`  
**Flat:** WOODLANDS (north), `storey_range="10 TO 12"`, amenities: mrt×1, hawker×2, mall×1, park×2, school×3, hospital×0  
*(Pre-filters already applied: ftype selects DB query, region restricts town list, budget/lease filter candidates)*

**Active criteria:** `budget>0` ✓ | `ftype≠"any"` ✓ | `regions≠[]` ✓ | `must_have=[]` ✗  
→ active = [budget, flat, region]  
→ W = [1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]  
*(amenity dims dampened to 0.25 — buyer expressed no amenity preference)*

**Buyer vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `FLOOR_PREF_ORD["mid"]` | 0.6600 |
| 1 | `"mrt" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 2 | `"hawker" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 3 | `"mall" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 4 | `"park" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 5 | `"school" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |
| 6 | `"hospital" NOT in must_have → 0.5 (neutral)` | 0.5000 |

**Flat vector:**

| Dim | How computed | Value |
|-----|-------------|-------|
| 0 | `storey_midpoint("10 TO 12") = 11 / 50` | 0.2200 |
| 1 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mrt"]=3` | 0.3333 |
| 2 | `count_within=2 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hawker"]=5` | 0.4000 |
| 3 | `count_within=1 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["mall"]=3` | 0.3333 |
| 4 | `count_within=2 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["park"]=4` | 0.5000 |
| 5 | `count_within=3 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["school"]=4` | 0.7500 |
| 6 | `count_within=0 / _AMENITY_COUNT_CAP["hospital"]=2` | 0.0000 |

**Why ≈0.96:** Floor preference is the only dim at full weight (W=1.0) — buyer=0.66 mid vs flat=0.22 differs but it's just one dim. All 6 amenity dims are dampened (W=0.25), so the estate's varied amenity counts barely affect the cosine angle. With dampened amenities contributing little, vectors stay nearly parallel.
